# What is Sider?
Sider is a in-memory database with persistence option. This is a personal project I'm coding to practice **Golang** by doing.

# What can Sider do?

- Read/Add keys 
- Push/Pop lists (LEFT and RIGHT)
- Expire lists/keys 
- Backup **lists** and **keys** in JSON files.
- Import last backup when starting Sider again

# TODO

- Add function to reverse lists
- Add function to find elements in lists
- Add function to check TTL of lists or keys
- Add os.Args to give the option to don't persist data
